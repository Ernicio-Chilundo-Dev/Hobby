🧮 Array Element Update Example in C

This is a basic C program that demonstrates how to update elements in an array using arithmetic operations.
📄 Description

The program initializes an integer array with three values: {10, 20, 30}.
It then updates the second element (arry[1]) to be the sum of the first and third elements (arry[0] + arry[2]).
Finally, it prints the updated value of arry[1] to the console.
